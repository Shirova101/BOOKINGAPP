# BOOKINGAPP
MERN Booking app(airbnb clone):
Leveraged the power of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to architect, design, and develop a responsive and user-friendly booking platform that mirrors Airbnb's core functionalities like registeration, logging in, listing properties and accomodations on the homepage and updating/deleting descriptive containers such as images, location and text.
